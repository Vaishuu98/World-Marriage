# World Marriage Dataset Analysis :

### Project Overview :
This project explores global marriage trends using real-world data. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and insights across different countries, cultures, and time periods.

### Objectives :
- Understand global patterns in marriage rates
- Analyze trends by region, income group, and year
- Visualize interesting correlations (e.g., marriage vs GDP, education, etc.)

---
### Tools & Libraries Used :
- **Python**:   pandas and numpy for data manipulation
- **Visualization**: seaborn and matplotlib for charts and trend analysis
- **Preprocessing**: LabelEncoder from scikit-learn for encoding categorical data
- **Jupyter Notebook** : for interactive analysis
- **GitHub** : for version control and project sharing


### Key Insights : 
- Highest marriage rates observed in [Country/Region]
- Decline in marriage rates correlated with [education/GDP/urbanization]
- Interesting trends over the decades, visualized clearly

### Sample Visuals : 

- Marital Status Distribution
- Distribution of Marital Status Across Genders
- Marital Status Trends Over the Years
- Marital Status Across Age Groups
- Detecting Outliers in Age Groups
- Correlation Matrix After Encoding

### Why This Project Matters : 
This project demonstrates:
- My ability to handle real-world data end-to-end
- Skills in data cleaning, wrangling, and visualization
- Strong storytelling and data-driven insights
